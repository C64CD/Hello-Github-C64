# Hello-Github-C64
Hello World - 6502 overkill version

This is just a simple scrolling message and sprites affair - source code in the .ASM file is formatted for the ACME
cross assembler which can be downloaded from http://sourceforge.net/projects/acme-crossass/ and the binary files
for music and sprite data are in "binary" with "workfiles" containing the Sprite Pad SPD file for the latter.

There's an assembled PRG included which should work on any PAL C64, C128, SX64 or C64DTV - it'll probably work on
NTSC as well but hasn't been tested.

T.M.R =-)
